The challenge was to create a micro-game where our character Durance can collect items during his adventure. Durance has many bags, but just the needed... at the most 1 backpack to storage 8 items and 4 small bags with 4 spaces each.

You have some actions to choose, pick items during your adventure, look into your bags and tidy up your bags.

# How can I run the game?
  - Clone this repo.
  - Install all dependencies with composer ```composer install```
  - run the game ```php src/main.php```
  
# How I play it?
After running the game automatically you will see a menu with different options. Use the menu to help Durance to collect items and order correctly into the bags.
